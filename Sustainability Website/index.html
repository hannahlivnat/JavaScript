                            <p>After you've addressed the highest priority items, start to look at the other aspects of your life that cause waste. 
                                What's left in your trashcan now, and how can you reduce it?

                                assessing where you spend your money. Are you buying dinner at restaurants that throw away pounds of plastic and unused food everyday? 
                                Are you frequenting stores that should have their own landfill? You've already changed your personal habits, now start impacting the community

                            <p>No one likes a preacher, but there are ways to impact your friends and family by simply modeling sustainable living. 
                                Engage in gentle conversations with your friends, buy sustainable presents that your family will still love. Becoming
                                a model through your actions will slowly have an impact on those around you, and you can always be ready to engage in 
                                a conversation about sustainability!
